## Considerations before running the app

Its completely necesary to configure the environment variables and conect to firebase.

### Environment variables

You must configure environment variables with the following key names:
```
REACT_APP_apiKey=value
REACT_APP_authDomain=value
REACT_APP_projectId=value
REACT_APP_storageBucket=value
REACT_APP_messagingSenderId=value
REACT_APP_appId=value
REACT_APP_measurementId=value
```
You obtain the key values from the info in your database in Firebase, you must replace instead of `value`.

### Firebase DB
There are some considerations you must have when conecting to the database in Firebase.
* The collection name is `companies`
* All the documents properties values are type `string`
* The documents properties fields must be the following:
  * `name`
  * `businessName`
  * `nit`
  * `phone`
  * `code`

## How does it work?

This is a dropdown search bar.

### 1. Make a search

You can write what you want to search in the search bar, after that you press the arrowdown icon to begin the search.
Once you have clicked the icon a list with the results will show. (20 results)

</p>

In case you did not write anything to search, and pressed the arrowdown icon. It will show 20 results.

</p>

If you write a new search while the dropdown list is open it will refresh the data obtained.

The list has a scroll down and if there are more results in the database that matches the search,
it will load more items if the scrollbar reaches the end of the list

</p>

### 3. Add new company

The value of the search is used to fill in the form according to its parameter. You can edit it.
